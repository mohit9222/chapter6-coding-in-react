Learn React With Mohit Series
Documenting my learning journey of Namaste React Live Course conducted by Akshay Saini

Class Summary Chapter - 05 Lets get Hooked (10/12/2023)
Chapter 5 continued the journey of our food delivery app project from the previous section. We focused on restructuring the repository, delved into the significance of clean coding practices, explored various methods of exporting and importing modules (components), and introduced the star of the show: Hooks. In a knowledge-packed session lasting three hours, Hooks took center stage as we laid the groundwork for their usage. Their application in filtering restaurants based on search input was a highlight. You can find a comprehensive breakdown of these concepts in my write-up in theory-assign.md.

Today's session provided a deeper insight into "Thinking in React," building upon the concepts discussed in the previous chapter. This approach was consistently applied throughout this section, detailed in coding-assignment.md.

In a nutshell, Hooks are simply functions managing local variables (state). They facilitate the creation of a state using useState() to establish an initial value and setState() to update it.
