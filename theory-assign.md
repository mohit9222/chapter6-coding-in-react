1. **What is Monolith architecture?**
- Monolith architecure is a traditional model of software development where the application is self - contained and independent from    other applications.
- It is also known as Single-tier(one-tier) architecture where a single application acts as client and server.
- Any small change to a single function requires compiling and testing of the entire application which is against todays agile approach.
  
**2. What is Mircoservice?**
- Microservice is architectural and organisational approach to software development where the software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.
- These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
- Eg: Netflix became the first high profile companies to migrate from Monolith architecture to cloud based Micro service architecture in 2009.
